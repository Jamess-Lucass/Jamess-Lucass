### Hey, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 22 year old developer, based in London. I enjoy working on every part of the stack and particulary enjoy problem solving and learning. I love working on all aspects which would be required in order to grow a scalable business, designing and building a frontend app, architecting backend services, ensuring they're resiliant, performant and secure, data storage and DevOps. Ensuring the developer experience for rolling out features across the applications are as seemless as possible.

All about picking the right tool for the job and love automation.
